# MySQL to Microsoft SQL Server data migration using the Wizard

### Basic Differences Between MySQL and SQL
There are many ways to migrate a MySQL Database to SQL Server, one of them can be using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA). However, in this section, we will explain how to manually transfer data from MySQL to Microsoft SQL Server through the Wizard.

### Why do we need to migrate MySQL database to MS SQL Server?
There may be several reasons for someone to consider transferring a MySQL database to Microsoft SQL Server:
1. An organization's specific requirements or preferences may demand the use of SQL Server rather than MySQL. This could be due to compatibility with other Microsoft products or requests from stakeholders.
2. SQL Server may outperform MySQL in terms of performance and scalability for some workloads. Depending on the application and its requirements, SQL Server may be more suitable for handling large amounts of data or high concurrency scenarios.
3. SQL Server and MySQL provide different sets of features and capabilities. If an application requires extensive analysis, integration with other Microsoft products, or enterprise-level functionality, migration to SQL Server may be necessary.
4. SQL Server provides a robust ecosystem with Microsoft support, which may appeal to companies that rely heavily on Microsoft technologies or are looking for a full support alternative.
5. In businesses with varied database setups, there may be an effort to standardize on a single database platform to facilitate manageability, maintenance and cost savings. In many situations, moving MySQL databases to SQL Server may be part of a larger consolidation effort.
